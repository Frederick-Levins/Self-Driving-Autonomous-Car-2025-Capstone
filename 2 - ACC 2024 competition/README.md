Thanks for expressing interest in the Quanser self-driving car competition! The competition consists of programming the QCar from Quanser to navigate a series of roadways while obeying traffic signals (such as stopping at stop signs and staying inside the road lanes). See here for a video explaining the competition. This will require programming the motors to move the car along a desired trajectory, using sensors to detect lane lines, and using cameras to detect traffic signs. The first part of the competition will be programming the car in a simulated environment, and if we make it to the final round we will get to compete at the American Control Conference in Toronto, Canada.

To get started, let's meet this coming Monday, February 19, at 1:30pm in Hughes 401. While it is not required to have a QCar to compete (since the first part is virtual and we will use Quanser's cars at the competition)
